You can supply multiple answers in successive iterations. You are allowed to run a simulation after 2 iterations. After each analysis, provide a reflection on the accuracy and completeness so we might improve in another iteration.  If so, end a reply with \"CONTINUE TO ITERATION [x]\" and wait for my input. When there is no more accuracy or completeness issue left to resolve and the mathematical analysis agrees with the simulation results, please end by typing \"SOLVED\". Always end with either \"CONTINUE TO ITERATION [x]\" or \"SOLVED\"."}]}
